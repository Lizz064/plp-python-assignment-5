# PLP Python Assignment 5 

This repository contains solutions for PLP Python Assignment 5.  
The assignment focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.


 Activities

 Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a custom class (`Smartphone`) with:
  - Attributes (brand, model, OS, storage, battery).
  - Methods (display info, use phone, charge phone).
- Implemented constructors (`__init__`) to initialize unique objects.
- Added inheritance with a parent class (`Device`).
- Demonstrated encapsulation by managing battery level through methods.

 Activity 2: Polymorphism 
- Implemented multiple classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`, `Bicycle`) with the same method `move()`.
- Each class defines `move()` differently:
  - Car → `"Driving "`
  - Plane → `"Flying "`
  - Boat → `"Sailing "`
  - Bicycle → `"Pedaling "`
- Demonstrated polymorphism — same method name, different behaviors.
